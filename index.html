<a id="irish-desitination" class="anchor" href="#irish-desitination" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Achill Island.</h3>

<p>Achill Island lies off County Mayo on the west coast of the Republic of Ireland. Marked by rugged mountains and peat bogs, the island is known for its tall sea cliffs and clean beaches. Its breezy shoreline makes it a popular spot for water sports. The strand (beach) at Keem Bay inspired visiting writers Heinrich Böll and Graham Greene. Keel, the island's main village, has a sandy surf beach</p>

<p>The Ring of Kerry is a scenic drive around the Iveragh Peninsula in southwest Ireland’s County Kerry. Its 179km-long, circular route takes in rugged and verdant coastal landscapes and rural seaside villages. Skellig Michael, a rocky island with an abandoned 7th-century Christian monastery, is a major destination point, with boats from Portmagee making the 12km crossing during the warmer months.</p>

<a id="cliffs-of-moher" class="anchor" href="#cliffs-of-moher" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Cliffs Of Moher</h3>

<p>The cliffs take their name from an old fort called Moher, which once stood on Hag's Head, the southernmost point of the cliffs.The cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped the list of attractions in 2006 by drawing almost one million visitors.In the 1990s, Clare County Council initiated development plans to enable visitors to experience the cliffs without significant intrusive man-made amenities. In keeping with this approach, the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience was built into a hillside approaching the cliffs. The centre is also intended to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling. </p>

<a id="the-giants-causeway" class="anchor" href="#the-giants-causeway" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Giants Causeway</h3>

<p>Northern Ireland's only UNESCO World Heritage-listed site, the Giant's Causeway is proof that Mother Nature provides the most dramatic tourist attractions. The natural wonder is comprised of around 40,000 polygonal basalt rock columns, formed by the ancient volcanic landscape and stretching along the coastline like a series of gigantic stepping stones. A Giants Causeway Day Trip from Belfast is one of the country's most popular excursions, with visitors taking the unique opportunity to walk one of nature's most peculiar pathways.</p>
